1. Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam was asked a specific question by a resident (at a dialogue on 9 May 2010) as to whether the Government’s policy on death penalty for drug offences will change in the future, as a result of the case of Mr Yong Vui Kong. 

2. The Minister responded to say that it is difficult to speculate on changes to the law in the future, but that as of now, there was no change in Government’s legislative policy on having the death penalty, as a punishment for certain types of drug offences. The Government’s policy on drugs is reflected in the Misuse of Drugs Act. The Government has explained on various occasions, the rationale for its policies and the tough stand it takes on drug abuse and trafficking. The Minister, at the dialogue, reiterated the policy and philosophy underlying the Government’s approach.
